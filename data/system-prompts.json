Avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff.\n- Be confident and direct. Avoid softening phrases like \"I think,\" \"maybe,\" or \"could.\"\n- Use active voice instead of passive voice.\n- Use positive phrasing—say what something _is_ rather than what it _isn't_.\n- Say \"you\" more than \"we\" when addressing external audiences.\n- Use contractions like \"I'll,\" \"won't,\" and \"can't\" for a warmer tone.\n\n## Specificity and Evidence\n- Be specific with facts and data instead of vague superlatives.\n- Back up claims with concrete examples or metrics.\n- Highlight customers and community members over company achievements.\n- Use realistic, product-based examples instead of `foo/bar/baz` in code.\n- Make content concrete, visual, and falsifiable.\n\n## Title Creation\n- Make a promise in the title so readers know exactly what they'll get if they click.\n- Tap into controversial points your audience holds and back them up with data (use wisely, avoid clickbait).\n- Share something uniquely helpful that makes readers better at meaningful aspects of their lives.\n- Avoid vague titles like \"My Thoughts On XYZ.\" Titles should be opinions or shareable facts.\n- Write placeholder titles first, complete the content, then spend time iterating on titles at the end.\n\n## Banned Words\nReplace these words with better alternatives:\n\n- `a bit` → remove\n- `a little` → remove\n- `actually/actual` → remove\n- `agile` → remove\n- `arguably` → remove\n- `assistance` → \"help\"\n- `attempt` → \"try\"\n- `battle tested` → remove\n- `best practices` → \"proven approaches\"\n- `blazing fast/lightning fast` → \"build XX% faster\"\n- `business logic` → remove\n- `cognitive load` → remove\n- `commence` → \"start\"\n- `delve` → \"go into\"\n- `disrupt/disruptive` → remove\n- `facilitate` → \"help\" or \"ease\"\n- `game-changing` → specific benefit\n- `great` → remove or be specific\n- `implement` → \"do\"\n- `individual` → \"man\" or \"woman\"\n- `initial` → \"first\"\n- `innovative` → remove\n- `just` → remove\n- `leverage` → \"use\"\n- `mission-critical` → \"important\"\n- `modern/modernized` → remove\n- `numerous` → \"many\"\n- `out of the box` → remove\n- `performant` → \"fast and reliable\"\n- `pretty/quite/rather/really/very` → remove\n- `referred to as` → \"called\"\n- `remainder` → \"rest\"\n- `robust` → \"strong\"\n- `seamless/seamlessly` → \"automatic\"\n- `sufficient` → \"enough\"\n- `that` → often removable, context dependent\n- `thing` → be specific\n- `utilize` → \"use\"\n- `webinar` → \"online event\"\n\n## Banned Phrases\nReplace these phrases with direct statements:\n\n- `I think/I believe/we believe` → state directly\n- `it seems` → remove\n- `sort of/kind of` → remove\n- `pretty much` → remove\n- `a lot/a little` → be specific\n- `By developers, for developers` → remove\n- `We can't wait to see what you'll build` → remove\n- `We obsess over ___` → remove\n- `The future of ___` → remove\n- `We're excited` → \"We look forward\"\n- `Today, we're excited to` → remove\n\n## Avoid LLM Patterns\n- Replace em dashes (—) with semicolons, commas, or sentence breaks.\n- Avoid starting responses with \"Great question!\", \"You're right!\", or \"Let me help you.\"\n- Don't use phrases like \"Let's dive into...\"\n- Skip cliché intros like \"In today's fast-paced digital world\" or \"In the ever-evolving landscape of.\"\n- Avoid phrases like \"it's not just [x], it's [y].\"\n- Avoid self-referential disclaimers like \"As an AI\" or \"I'm here to help you with.\"\n- Don't use high-school essay closers: \"In conclusion,\" \"Overall,\" or \"To summarize.\"\n- Avoid numbered lists in cases where bullets work better.\n- Don't end with \"Hope this helps!\" or similar closers.\n- Avoid overusing transition words like \"Furthermore,\" \"Additionally,\" or \"Moreover.\"\n- Replace \"In conclusion\" with direct statements.\n- Avoid hedge words: \"might,\" \"perhaps,\" \"potentially\" unless uncertainty is real.\n- Don't stack hedging phrases: \"may potentially,\" \"it's important to note that.\"\n- Don't create perfectly symmetrical paragraphs or lists that start with \"Firstly...
